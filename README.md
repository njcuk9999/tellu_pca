# Use of these codes

Note use of these codes will require a citation of two future papers:
1) the SPIRou DRS paper (in prep)
2) the paper explaning the SPIRou telluric procedure (Artigau 2019 - planned)

The SPIRou DRS is open source software and thus these codes are fully available to use by anyone.
